# How to use this template

1. Make a new branch. If working on an internal ticket, include it at the start of the name. For example, DOC-123-feature-summary.
2. Create a new file, or find the file you want to edit, in integrations/builtin/core-nodes/. If creating a new file, pay attention to the naming conventions: it should match the node name in the codex file. For example, in the Item Lists node, the codex file (https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/ItemLists/ItemLists.node.json) reads: `"node": "n8n-nodes-base.itemList"`. So the app node file name is n8n-nodes-base.itemList.
3. Copy the template into the file (don't copy this comment).
4. Placeholder text is in _italic_ or between <>. Make sure to replace it! 
5. Before publishing, delete any comments.

Use the style guide: https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/wiki
You can find more info on working with the docs project in the README: https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/main/README.md

<!-- 
The title should be the name of the node. Add "trigger" if it's a core trigger node. For example:
Item Lists
Local File trigger
-->
# <Name>

_Briefly summarize the functionality._

## Related resources

### Credentials

_Link to the credentials doc, if there is one. If this node doesn't need credentials, remove this section. Most core nodes don't have credentials._

### Examples

* _List of links_
* _To blog posts_
* _And integrations marketing pages_

## Operations

* _Bullet list_
* _Of available operations_.
