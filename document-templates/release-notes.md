# How to use this template

1. Make a new branch, including the release number in the name. For example: 0.190.0-release-note
2. Copy the template into the top of the release note file: https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/main/docs/reference/release-notes.md (don't copy this comment).
3. Add the link to the GitHub change comparison. For example: https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.189.1...n8n@0.190.0 You can find this link from the GitHub changelog doc: https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md
4. Placeholder text is in _italic_. Make sure to replace it! Refer to the GitHub changelog to help get started: https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md For minor changes, you may be able to copy directly from that changelog. For larger features, or if anything is unclear, do some research and add more detail.

Make sure to refer to the style guide: https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/wiki
You can find more info on working with the docs project in the README: https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/main/README.md
