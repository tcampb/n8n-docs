# How to use this template

1. Make a new branch. If working on an internal ticket, include it at the start of the name. For example, DOC-123-feature-summary.
2. Create a new file, or find the file you want to edit, in integrations/builtin/credentials/. If creating a new file, the name should be the integration name.
3. Copy the template into the file (don't copy this comment).
4. Placeholder text is in _italic_ or between <>. Make sure to replace it! 
5. Before publishing, delete any comments.

Use the style guide: https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/wiki
You can find more info on working with the docs project in the README: https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/main/README.md

-->

<!-- 
The title should be the name of the integration.
Match the brand name exactly. For example, GitHub NOT Github
-->
# _Name_

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes with _Name_:

* _List of apps_
* _That use these credentials_

## Prerequisites

_Include info on services they need to sign up for_


## Using _Auth method_
	
_Link to product's docs for this auth method._
	
_STOP AND THINK: does this node require a step by step? If authentication is easy to set up, or if this node isn't heavily used, consider leaving out the step by step to minimise maintenance._

_IF NEEDED: Include a step by step guide to how to set up a particular type of authentication. If multiple auth methods are available, create a section for each. For example, the Asana credentials have two sections: one for OAuth and one for access token (https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/asana/)_

<!-- 
Add any other sections here. 
You should include: quirks, pain points, complex topics that trip people up
