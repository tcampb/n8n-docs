# Merging items

You might want to merge items together in your workflows. For example when your data contains hundreds of items that you don't want to process individually. 

There are three different use cases for merging items:

* **Merge items of a single execution**: You can merge all incoming items into a single item using the Item Lists node. Please note that since you are merging different items into a single item the next node in the workflow will now process just that single item.
* **Merge items returned by different nodes**: If you want to merge items returned by different nodes, use the [Merge node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/).
* **Merge items of different executions**: You can also merge items that get returned in different executions. Refer to this [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1160) to learn how:
