## Help out the community

You can participate in the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/){:target=_blank class=.external-link} and help the community members out with their questions.

When sharing workflows in the community forum for debugging, use code blocks. Use triple backticks ` ``` ` to wrap the workflow JSON in a code block.

The following video demonstrates the steps of sharing workflows on the community forum:

## Contribute a workflow

You can publish workflows on [n8n.io](https://n8n.io/workflows){:target=_blank class=.external-link} to help other users to get started.

To share a workflow, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to [n8n.io](https://n8n.io/login){:target=_blank class=.external-link}.
2. Open the [workflows](https://n8n.io/workflows){:target=_blank class=.external-link} page.
3. Select **+ Share New Workflow**.
4. Enter the name of your workflow in the **Name** field. The name should be short and descriptive, so that other users can understand the purpose of the workflow at a glance.
5. Enter a detailed description of the workflow in the **Description** field. Add a screenshot of the workflow and briefly explain what the nodes used in the workflow do.
6. In your n8n instance, select all the nodes in your workflow (Ctrl + A or Cmd + A) and copy them (Ctrl + C or Cmd + C).
7. Back on the workflows page, delete the existing code in the **Workflow Code** field and paste your workflow in it (Ctrl + V or Cmd + V).
8. Select **Publish Workflow to Share** to share your workflow.

See the above steps in action in this video:

## Build a node

Create an integration for a third party service. Check out [the node creation docs](/integrations/creating-nodes/) for guidance on how to create and publish a community node.

## Contribute to the code

There are different ways in which you can contribute to the n8n code base:

- Fix [issues](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/issues){:target=_blank class=.external-link} reported on GitHub. The [CONTRIBUTING guide](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md){:target=_blank class=.external-link} will help you get your development environment ready in minutes.
- Add additional functionality to an existing third party integration.
- Add a new feature to n8n.

## Contribute to the docs

You can contribute to the n8n documentation, for example by documenting nodes or fixing issues.

The repository for the docs is [here](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs){:target=_blank class=.external-link} and the guidelines for contributing to the docs are [here](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md){:target=_blank class=.external-link}.

## Write a blog post

You can write an article for the [n8n blog](https://n8n.io/blog/){:target=_blank class=.external-link}. Your article can be, for example, a [workflow tutorial](https://n8n.io/blog/tag/tutorial/){:target=_blank class=.external-link}, an opinion piece on automation, or some domain-specific [automation ideas](https://n8n.io/blog/tag/ideas/){:target=_blank class=.external-link}. 

[This board](https://github.com/orgs/n8n-io/projects/3){:target=_blank .external-link} lists the most in-demand topics.

### Process to submit a post

n8n appreciates all contributions. Publishing a tutorial on your own site that supports the community is a great contribution. However, if you want n8n to highlight your post on our blog, you need to go through this process.

#### 1. Submit your idea

Submit your idea to n8n's [contributor board](https://github.com/orgs/n8n-io/projects/3){:target=_blank /external-link}. You can either:

* Offer to write a post for an idea in the **Blog posts** column. To do this, comment on the ticket and tag the ticket owner.
* Propose a new idea. To do this, comment on a **Submit your idea here** ticket (make sure to choose one that isn't already being used).

When commenting, include as much detail as you can. If possible, provide an outline for your proposed post.

#### 2. Approval

n8n reviews your comment and responds. This includes a review and feedback on your outline.

#### 3. Submit your draft

Write your post in a Google Doc, following the [style guide](https://n8n.notion.site/n8n-blog-writing-style-97dc73436a624933b75ddc941a361b70){:target=_blank .external-link}.

When your draft is ready, share it in the GitHub ticket. Make sure the sharing link gives permission for anyone to comment.

If your blog post includes example workflows, export your workflow and copy the JSON into a separate section at the end of your blog post doc.

If you want to have ownership of the article, submit a second Google Doc link with your full name, a short byline, and your image. n8n will use this to create your author page and credit you as the author of the post.

#### 4. Review and edit

Someone from n8n reviews your draft. They'll check the following:

* Is the information accurate and up to date?
* Do the workflows or other examples function?
* Is the product information relevant?
* Gramma and structure

After the review, you'll have a chance to review any suggested changes and implement them. You can then notify the reviewer that your final draft is ready.

#### 5. Publishing

n8n will let you know an estimated publication date. 

When the article is published, n8n will also promote it through social media. You're encouraged to share it on your own channels.

## Refer a candidate

Do you know someone who would be a great fit for one of our [open positions](https://n8n.io/careers){:target=_blank class=.external-link}? Refer them to us! In return, we'll pay you €1,000 when the referral successfully passes their probationary period.

Here's how this works:

1. **Search**: Have a look at the description and requirements of each role, and consider if someone you know would be a great fit.
2. **Referral**: Once you've identified a potential candidate, send an email to [Jobs at n8n](mailto:jobs@n8n.io) with the subject line *Employee referral - [job title]* and a short description of the person you're referring (and the reason why). Also, tell your referral to apply for the job through our [careers page](https://n8n.io/careers){:target=_blank class=.external-link}.
3. **Evaluation**: We'll screen the application and inform you about the next steps of the hiring process.
4. **Reward**: As soon as your referral has successfully finished the probationary period, we'll reward you for your efforts by transferring the €1,000 to your bank account.
