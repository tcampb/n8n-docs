# Choose your n8n

There are a few different ways to set up n8n depending on how you intend to use it:

* [n8n Cloud](/choose-n8n/cloud/): hosted solution, no need to install anything.
* [Desktop app](/choose-n8n/desktop-app/): the fastest way to try out n8n on your computer.
* [Self-host](/hosting/): recommended method for production or customized usecases.
	* [npm](/hosting/installation/npm/)
	* [Docker](/hosting/installation/docker/)
	* [Server setup guides](/hosting/server-setups/) for popular platforms
