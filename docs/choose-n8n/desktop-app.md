## Desktop app

The n8n desktop app is the fastest way to try n8n on Windows or Mac computers (support for Linux is coming soon). Download the app from the link below:

[Download for Windows](https://downloads.n8n.io/file/n8n-downloads/n8n-win.zip)

[Download for macOS](https://downloads.n8n.io/file/n8n-downloads/n8n-mac.zip)

!!! note "Keep in mind"
    If you have already installed n8n locally via `npm`, the desktop app will connect to the existing `sqlite` database.


!!! note "Tunnel credentials"
    The n8n desktop creates a tunnel in order to receive webhooks from external services such as Google. This tunnel is protected using a randomly generated combination of username and password. If you are asked for a login to your personal tunnel URL, you can find the generated credentials in the `n8n-desktop.env` file in the `.n8n` folder of your home directory.
