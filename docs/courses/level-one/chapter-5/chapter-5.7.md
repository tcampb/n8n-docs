# 7. Scheduling the Workflow

In this step of the workflow you will learn how to schedule your workflow so that it runs automatically at a set time/interval using the Cron node.

The workflow you've built so far executes only when you click on _Execute Workflow_. But Nathan needs it to run automatically every Monday morning. You can do this with the [Schedule Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/), which allows you to schedule workflows to run periodically at fixed dates, times, or intervals.

In your workflow, add the Schedule trigger node, and configure its parameters:

* _Mode:_ Every Week
* _Hour:_ 9
* _Minute:_ 0
* _Weekday:_ Monday

!!! warning "Keep in mind"
    To ensure accurate scheduling with the Cron node, be sure the timezone is set correctly for your n8n instance (or the workflow).


## What's next?

**You üë©‚Äçüîß**: That was it for the workflow! I've added and configured all necessary nodes. Now every time you click on Execute Workflow, all nodes will be executed: getting, filtering, calculating, and transferring the sales data.

**Nathan üôã**: This is just what I needed! So now my workflow will run automatically every Monday morning?

**You üë©‚Äçüîß**: Not so fast. To do that, you need to activate your workflow. I'll do this in the next step and show you how to interpret the execution log.
