# Risks when using community nodes

Using community nodes means you are installing unverified code from a public source into your n8n instance. This has some risks.

Risks include:

* System security: community nodes have full access to the machine that n8n runs on, and can do anything, including malicious actions.
* Data security: any community node that you use has access to data in your workflows.
* Breaking changes: node developers may introduce breaking changes in new versions of their nodes. A breaking change is an update that breaks previous functionality. Depending on the node versioning approach that a node developer chooses, upgrading to a version with a breaking change could cause all workflows using the node to break. Be careful when upgrading your nodes.
