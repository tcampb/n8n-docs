# Respond to Webhook

The *Respond to Webhook* node can be used in workflows with a [Webhook](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/) node. It allows controlling the response to incoming webhooks. In the Webhook node, the **Using 'Respond to Webhook' node** option would need to be selected in the **Response** dropdown for the *Respond to Webhook* node to work.

!!! note "Expressions"
    When using [expressions](/code-examples/expressions/), the *Respond to Webhook* node will only run for the first item in the input data


## Node reference

The node supports the following modes through the **Respond With** field:

- **First Incoming Item**: Respond with the first incoming item's JSON.
- **Text**: Respond with a text defined in the **Response Body** field.
- **JSON**: Respond with a JSON object defined in the **Response Body** field.
- **Binary**: Respond with a binary file defined in the **Response Data Source** field.
- **No Data**: No response payload is sent.

Available options:

- **Response Code**: Set the [response code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) to be used.
- **Response Headers**: Define response headers to be sent.

## Workflow behaviour

When using the *Respond to Webhook* node, workflows will behave as follows:

- When the workflow finishes without executing the *Respond to Webhook* node, a standard message is returned with a 200 status.
- If a second *Respond to Webhook* node is executed after the first one, it is ignored.
- If the workflow errors before the first *Respond to Webhook* node is executed, an error message is returned with a 500 status.
- If a *Respond to Webhook* node is executed but there was no webhook, the *Respond to Webhook* node is ignored.

## Example Usage

This workflow allows serves an HTML page when receiving a GET requests. You can find the complete workflow [here on n8n.io](https://n8n.io/workflows/1306). The example workflow uses the following nodes:

- [Webhook](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/)
- [Respond to Webhook]()

### 1. Webhook node

This node will receive incoming requests (for example, when the webhook URL is opened with a browser).

1. Enter a human-readable value in the **path** field, for example `my-form`.
2. Choose the **Using 'Respond to Webhook' node** option **Response** dropdown.
3. Click on **Execute Node** to run the node.
4. Open the URL shown in the **Test URL** field under **Webhook URLs** in a new browser tab.

### 2. Respond to Webhook node

This node will define the response to the request received in the previous step.

1. Connect the *Webhook* node from the previous step to the new *Respond to Webhook* node.
2. Choose the **Text** option in the **Respond With** dropdown.
3. Enter some basic HTML into the **Response Body** field (for example the [Bootstrap Starter template](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/#starter-template)).
4. Click **Add Option** > **Response Headers** > **Add Response Header** to add a header to the response.
5. Enter `Content-Type` in the **Name** field and `text/html; charset=UTF-8` in the value field of the new header.
6. Close the *Respond to Webhook* modal and click the **Execute Workflow** button.
7. Open the **Test URL** from the *Webhook* node in a new browser tab. The browser should now show the page added defined in the **Response Body** field of the *Respond to Webhook* node.
