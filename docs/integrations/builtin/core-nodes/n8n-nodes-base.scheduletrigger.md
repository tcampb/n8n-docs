# Schedule Trigger

Use the Schedule Trigger node run workflows at fixed intervals and times. This works in a similar way to the cron software utility in Unix-like systems.

!!! note "Cron node"
	The Code node replaces the Cron node from version 0.199.0 onwards. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can still view the [Cron node documentation](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/67935ad2528e2e30d7984ea917e4af2910a096ec/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.cron.md){:target=_blank .external-link}.

!!! note "Keep in mind" 
	1. If a workflow uses the Schedule node as a trigger, make sure that you save and activate the workflow. 
	2. Set the timezone correctly for the n8n instance (or the workflow).


## Schedule your workflow

Select an interval in **Trigger Interval**. Once you select an interval, n8n displays more options to customize that interval.

### Example

In this example, schedule a workflow to run once a quarter, at the end of the quarter, at 09:00.

1. In **Trigger Interval**, select **Months**.
2. Change **Months Between Triggers** to `3`.
3. To run the workflow at the end of the month, change **Trigger at Day of Month** to `28`.
4. Change **Trigger at Hour** to **9am**. Leave **Trigger at Minute** as its default, `0`.

Note that the Schedule Trigger uses the workflow timezone if available. Otherwise it uses the n8n instance timezone. 

## Generate a custom cron expression

If you need a custom time setting, select **Trigger Interval** > **Custom (Cron)**.

To generate a cron expression, you can use [crontab guru](https://crontab.guru){:target=_blank .external-link}. Paste the cron expression that you generated using crontab guru in the **Expression** field in n8n.

### Examples

If you want to trigger your workflow every day at 04:08:30, enter the following in the **Cron Expression** field.
```
30 8 4 * * *
```

If you want to trigger your workflow every day at 04:08, enter the following in the **Cron Expression** field.
```
8 4 * * *
```

### Why there are six asterisks (*) in the cron expression?

The sixth asterisk in the cron expression represents seconds. Setting this is optional. The node will execute even if you don't set the value for seconds.
