# Read PDF

The Read PDF node is used to read data from PDF documents and extract its content as text.

!!! note "Keep in mind"
    You will need to use an additional node such as the [Read Binary File](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readbinaryfile/) node or the [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node to pass the image file as a data property to the Read PDF node.


## Node Reference

The Read PDF node has one property:

1. *Binary Property* field: This field specifies the name of the data property used to read the PDF file in n8n.

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to read a PDF file using the Read PDF node. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/585) on the website. This example usage workflow would use the following three nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [Read Binary File](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readbinaryfile/)
- [PDF Read]()


The final workflow should look like the following image.

### 1. Start node

The start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.

### 2. Read Binary File
1. Enter the path to the PDF file you want to read in the *File Path* field.

### 3. Read PDF node

1. Enter the *Property Name* you used in the previous node in the *Binary Property* field.
2. Click on *Execute Node* to run the workflow.
