## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to convert the JSON data received from the [CocktailDB API](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/) to XML. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/661) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow uses the following nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/)
- [XML]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

### 1. Start node

The start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.


### 2. HTTP Request node (GET)

1. Enter `https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/random.php` in the ***URL*** field.
2. Click on ***Execute Node*** to run the node.
