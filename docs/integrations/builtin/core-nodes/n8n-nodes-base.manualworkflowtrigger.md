# Manual Trigger

Use this node if you want to start a workflow by selecting **Execute Workflow**, and don't want any option for the workflow to run automatically.

Workflows always need a trigger (start point). In most cases, a trigger node starts the workflow in response to an external event. However, you still need a trigger node even when starting the workflow manually.
