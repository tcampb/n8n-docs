# Interval

The Interval node is used to trigger the workflow to run in regular intervals of time. This node is a Trigger node.

!!! note "Keep in mind"
    If a workflow is using the Interval node as a trigger, make sure that you save and activate the workflow.


The Interval node has two fields:
1. *Interval* field: This is a numerical field where you can specify the interval after which the workflow should get triggered again.
2. *Unit* field: This is a dropdown list which allows you to select a unit for the value that was provided for the *Interval* field. This field offers the following options for its dropdown list:
    - Seconds
    - Minutes
    - Hours
