# IF

The IF node is used to split a workflow conditionally based on comparison operations.

## Node Reference

You can add comparison conditions using the **Add Condition** dropdown. Conditions can be created based on the data type, the available comparison operations vary for each data type.

**Boolean**

- Equal
- Not Equal


**Number**

- Smaller
- Smaller Equal
- Equal
- Not Equal
- Larger
- Larger Equal
- Is Empty


**String**

- Contains
- Equal
- Not Contains
- Not Equal
- Regex
- Is Empty


You can choose to split a workflow when any of the specified conditions are met, or only when all the specified conditions are met using the options in the **Combine** dropdown list.

## Branch execution with If and Merge nodes

## Example Usage

This workflow executes two different *Set* nodes based on the output given by an *IF* node. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/581) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow would use the following nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [Code](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/)
- [IF]()
- [Set](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/)


The final workflow should look like the following image.

### 1. Start node

The start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.


### 2. Code node

1. Enter the following code:
```
return [
  {
    json: {
      id: 0,
    }
  },
  {
    json: {
      id: 1,
    }
  }
];
```
2. Click on **Execute Node** to run the workflow.

### 3. IF node


1. Click on the **Add Condition** button and select 'Number' from the dropdown list.
2. Click on the gears icon next to the **Value 1** field and click on **Add Expression**.
3. Select the following in the **Variable Selector** section: Nodes > Function > Output Data > JSON > ID. You can also add the following expression: `{{$node["Function"].json["id"]}}`.
4. From the **Operation** dropdown list, select 'Equal'.
5. Click on **Execute Node** to run the workflow.

### 4. Set node (for 'true' condition)

1. Create a Set node connected to the 'true' output of the IF node.
2. Click on the **Add Value** button and select 'String' from the dropdown list.
3. Enter `name` in the **Name** field.
4. Enter `n8n` in the **Value** field.
5. Click on **Execute Node** to run the workflow.

**Note:** Notice that only the ID with the value 0 made its way to this Set node.

### 5. Set1 node (for 'false' condition)

1. Create a *Set* node connected to the 'false' output of the IF node.
2. Click on the **Add Value** button and select 'String' from the dropdown list.
3. Enter `name` in the **Name** field.
4. Enter `nodemation` in the **Value** field.
5. Click on **Execute Node** to run the workflow.

**Note:** Notice that only the ID with the value 1 made its way to this *Set* node.
