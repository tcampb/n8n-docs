# SSH

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [SSH](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.ssh/)

## Prerequisites

Authentication for the SSH node requires that you have a username and password for connecting to the remote server, or an SSH key configured for the server or service you are connecting to. 
See [Connecting to GitHub with SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) for an example.

## Using Password

    - ***Credentials Name***: Enter a descriptive name, here we used `ssh_demo`.

    - ***Port***: Enter the port to use for this connection. SSH used port 22 by default.
    - ***User***: Enter the your username for this server.
