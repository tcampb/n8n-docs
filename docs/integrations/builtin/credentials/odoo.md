# Odoo credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes with Odoo:

- [Odoo](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.odoo/)

1. Sign up for Odoo and create an API key or password. Refer to Odoo's documentation for more information: [External API](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/15.0/developer/misc/api/odoo.html). Note that some Odoo modules and settings require API keys, not passwords.
2. In n8n, create a new credential. You can either:
    * Click **Credentials** > **New**, then search for **Odoo API**. After selecting **Odoo API**, click **Continue**.
    * In an Odoo node, click the **Credential for Odoo API** dropdown, then click **Create new**.
3. Enter your Odoo information:
    * **Site URL**: the domain of your Odoo instance.
    * **Username**: username as displayed on the user's **Change password** screen in Odoo.
    * **Database name**: the name of the Odoo instance.
    * **Password or API key**: the credential you created in step one.
4. Click **Save**. n8n tests the key to check it can connect to Odoo.
