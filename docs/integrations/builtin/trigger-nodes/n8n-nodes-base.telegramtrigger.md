## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to receive messages using the Telegram Trigger node and send an image of a cocktail when a message is received. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/782) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow would use the following nodes.

- [Telegram Trigger]()
- [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/)
- [Telegram](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegram/)

The final workflow should look like the following image.
