# Clockify Trigger

[Clockify](https://clockify.me/) is a free time tracker and timesheet app for tracking work hours across projects.

!!! note "Credentials"
    You can find authentication information for this node [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/clockify/).


**Note:** This node uses the workflow timezone setting to specify the range of time entries starting time. You have to configure the workflow timezone setting if you want this Trigger node to retrieve the right time entries.

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to get new time entries from Clockify. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/536) on the website. This example usage workflow would use the following node.

- [Clockify Trigger]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.
