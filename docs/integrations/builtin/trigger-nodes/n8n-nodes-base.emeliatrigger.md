The Emelia Trigger node will trigger the workflow when a lead sends a reply to the campaign `n8n`. If you have a different campaign, use that instead.

1. First of all, you'll have to enter credentials for the Emelia Trigger node. You can find out how to do that [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/emelia/).
2. Select a campaign from the ***Campaign*** dropdown list.
3. Select 'Email Replied' from the ***Events*** dropdown list.
4. Click on ***Execute Node*** to run the node.

In the screenshot below, you will notice that the node triggers the workflow when a lead sends a reply. This output is passed on to the next node in the workflow.
