!!! note "Credentials"
    You can find authentication information for this node [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/mautic/).


## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to receive updates when a form is submitted in Mautic using the Mautic Trigger node and send an SMS confirmation to the submitter. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/721) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow would use the following node.

- [Mautic Trigger]()
- [Twilio](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.twilio/)

The final workflow should look like the following image.

### 1. Mautic Trigger node

The Mautic Trigger node will trigger the workflow when a Mautic form is submitted.

2. Select 'Form Submit Event' from the ***Events*** dropdown list.
3. Click on ***Execute Node*** to run the node.
