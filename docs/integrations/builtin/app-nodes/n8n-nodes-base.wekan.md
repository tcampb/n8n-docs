## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to create a board and two lists called `To Do` and `Done` using the Wekan node. It also allows you to create a card and update the list ID of the card, enabling you to move it from the `To Do` list to the `Done` list. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/728) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow uses the following nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [Wekan]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

### 1. Start node

The start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.


### 2. Wekan node (create: board)

This node will create a board called `Documentation` in Wekan. To create a board with a different name, you can enter the name of your board instead.

1. First of all, you'll have to enter credentials for the Wekan node. You can find out how to do that [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/wekan/).

2. Select 'Board' from the ***Resource*** dropdown list.
3. Enter `Documentation` in the ***Title*** field.
4. Select the owner of the board from the ***Owner*** dropdown list.
5. Click on ***Execute Node*** to run the node.

In the screenshot below, you will notice that the node creates a new board with the title `Documentation`.

### 3. Wekan1 node (create: list)

This node will create a list with the title `To Do` in the `Documentation` board, which was created using the previous node.

1. Select the credentials that you entered in the previous node.
2. Select 'List' from the ***Resource*** dropdown list.
3. Click on the gears icon next to the ***Board ID*** field and click on ***Add Expression***.
4. Select the following in the ***Variable Selector*** section: Nodes > Wekan > Output Data > JSON > _id. You can also add the following expression: `{{$node["Wekan"].json["_id"]}}`.
5. Enter `To Do` in the ***Title*** field.
6. Click on ***Execute Node*** to run the node.

In the screenshot below, you will notice that the node creates a new list called `To Do` in the `Documentation` board.

### 4. Wekan2 node (create: list)

This node will create a list with the title `Done` in the `Documentation` board, which was created using the Wekan node.

1. Select the credentials that you entered in the previous node.
2. Select 'List' from the ***Resource*** dropdown list.
3. Click on the gears icon next to the ***Board ID*** field and click on ***Add Expression***.
4. Select the following in the ***Variable Selector*** section: Nodes > Wekan > Output Data > JSON > _id. You can also add the following expression: `{{$node["Wekan"].json["_id"]}}`.
5. Enter `Done` in the ***Title*** field.
6. Click on ***Execute Node*** to run the node.

In the screenshot below, you will notice that the node creates a new list called `Done` in the `Documentation` board.

## FAQs

### How to load all the parameters for the node?

To load all the parameters, for example, Author ID, you need to give admin permissions to the user. Refer to the [Wekan documentation](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Features#members-click-member-initials-or-avatar--permissions-adminnormalcomment-only) to learn how to change permissions.
