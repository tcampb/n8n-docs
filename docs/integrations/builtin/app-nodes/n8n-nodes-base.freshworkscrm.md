## Example usage

This workflow allows you to fetch all Contacts in Freshworks CRM that you have yet to contact. This example usage workflow would use the following two nodes:

- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [Freshworks CRM]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.
