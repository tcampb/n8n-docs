# SIGNL4

[SIGNL4](https://www.signl4.com/) is a plug-and-play cloud solution produced by Derdack. It automatically notifies teams on their mobile devices in case of critical events.

!!! note "Credentials"
    You can find authentication information for this node [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/signl4/).


## Basic Operations

* Alert
    * Send an alert
    * Resolve an alert

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to send an alert on SIGNL4. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/441) on the website. This example usage workflow would use the following two nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [SIGNL4]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.
