[Humantic AI](https://humantic.ai/) provides AI-driven behavior and personality assessment of a candidate.

!!! note "Credentials"
    You can find authentication information for this node [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/humanticAi/).


## Basic Operations

* Profile
    * Create a profile
    * Retrieve a profile
    * Update a profile

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to create, update, and get a profile using the Humantic AI node. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/784) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow uses the following nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/)
- [Humantic AI]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

### 1. Start node

The Start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.

### 2. Humantic AI node (create: profile)

This node will create a new profile for a candidate in Humantic AI. We will create a new profile using the LinkedIn URL of a candidate.
