## Example

This workflow allows you to create a new event in Action Network, then create a new person and mark them as having attended your event. This workflow uses the following two nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [ActiveCampaign]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.
