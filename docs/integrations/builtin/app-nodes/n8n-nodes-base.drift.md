## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to create a contact in Drift. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/497) on the website. This example usage workflow would use the following two nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [Drift]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

### 1. Start node

The start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.

### 2. Drift node

1. First of all, you'll have to enter credentials for the Drift node. You can find out how to do that [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/drift/).
2. Enter the email of the contact in the *Email* field.
3. Click on *Execute Node* to run the workflow.
