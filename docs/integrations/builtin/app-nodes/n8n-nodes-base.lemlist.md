## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to list emails from Airtable and create corresponding leads in Lemlist. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/983) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow uses the following nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [Airtable]/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.airtable/)
- [Lemlist]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.
