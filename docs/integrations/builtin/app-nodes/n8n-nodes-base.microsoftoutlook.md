## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to create, add an attachment, and send a draft using the Microsoft Outlook node. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/867) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow uses the following nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [Microsoft Outlook]()
- [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/)

The final workflow should look like the following image.

### 1. Start node

The start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.

### 2. Microsoft Outlook node (create: draft)

This node will create a draft message that we will send using the Microsoft Outlook node later in the workflow.

1. First of all, you'll have to enter credentials for the Microsoft Outlook node. You can find out how to do that [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/microsoft/).
2. Select 'Draft' from the ***Resource*** dropdown list.
3. Enter the subject in the ***Subject*** field.
4. Enter the following content in the ***Body Content*** field.
```html
<h1>Hello from n8n!</h1>
<p>We are sending this email using the Microsoft Outlook node in <a href="https://n8n.io">n8n</a></p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Sender</p>
```
5. Click on ***Add Field*** and select 'Body Content Type' from the dropdown list.
6. Click on ***Execute Node*** to run the node.

In the screenshot below, you will notice that the node creates a new draft with the subject `Hello from n8n!` and HTML body content.

### 3. HTTP Request node (GET)

This node will fetch the logo of n8n from a URL. We will attach this file to our draft message that we created earlier. If you want to attach a different file, enter the URL of that file instead.

1. Enter `https://n8n.io/n8n-logo.png` in the ***URL*** field.
2. Select 'File' from the ***Response Format*** dropdown list.
3. Click on ***Execute Node*** to run the node.

In the screenshot below, you will notice that the node returns the n8n logo. We will attach this file to the draft message that we created using the previous node.
