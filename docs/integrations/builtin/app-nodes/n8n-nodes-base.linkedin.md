# LinkedIn

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) is an employment-oriented online service. It is mainly used for professional networking, including employers posting jobs and job seekers posting their CVs.

!!! note "Credentials"
    You can find authentication information for this node [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/linkedIn/).


## Basic Operations

* Post
    * Create a new post

!!! note "Keep in mind"
    If posting as an Organization enter only the organization number in the URN field. For example, `03262013` not `urn:li:company:03262013`.


## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to get an image from a URL and post it on LinkedIn. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/681) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow would use the following nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/)
- [LinkedIn]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.
