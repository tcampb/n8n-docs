## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to create a new member and update their information in Orbit using the Orbit node. It also allows you to create a note and a post for the new member in Orbit. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/765) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow uses the following nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [Orbit]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

### 1. Start node

The Start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.


### 2. Orbit node (upsert: member)

This node will create a new member in a workspace in Orbit. We will use the GitHub identity to create a new member.

1. First of all, you'll have to enter credentials for the Orbit node. You can find out how to do that [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/orbit/).
2. Select 'Upsert' from the ***Operation*** dropdown list.
3. Select the workspace where you want to create a new member from the ***Workspace*** dropdown list.
4. Click on the ***Add Identity*** button.
5. Select 'GitHub' from the ***Source*** dropdown list.
6. Select 'Username' from the ***Search By*** dropdown list.
7. Enter the GitHub username of the member in the ***Username*** field.
8. Click on ***Execute Node*** to run the node.

In the screenshot below, you will notice that the node creates a new member in a workspace in Orbit using the GitHub identity.

### 3. Orbit1 node (update: member)

This node will update the tags of the member that we created in the previous node.

1. Select the credentials that you entered in the previous node.
2. Select 'Update' from the ***Operation*** dropdown list.
3. Click on the gears icon next to the ***Workspace*** field and click on ***Add Expression***.
4. Select the following in the ***Variable Selector*** section: Nodes > Orbit > Parameters > workspaceId. You can also add the following expression: `{{$node["Orbit"].parameter["workspaceId"]}}`.
5. Click on the gears icon next to the ***Member ID*** field and click on ***Add Expression***.
6. Select the following in the ***Variable Selector*** section: Nodes > Orbit > Output Data > JSON > id. You can also add the following expression: `{{$node["Orbit"].json["id"]}}`.
7. Click on the ***Add Field*** button and select 'Tags to Add'.
8. Enter the tags in the ***Tags to Add*** field. You can add multiple tags by separating them with a comma.
9. Click on ***Execute Node*** to run the node.

In the screenshot below, you will notice that the node updates the information of the new member that we created in the previous node. The node adds the tags `n8nConf` and `MLH` to the new member.
