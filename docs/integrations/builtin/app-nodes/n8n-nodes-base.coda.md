## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to insert data into a new row for a table in Coda. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/482) on the website. This example usage workflow would use the following three nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [Set](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/)
- [Coda]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

### 1. Start node

The start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.

### 2. Set node

1. Click on the *Add Value* button and select 'String' from the dropdown list.
2. Enter `Column 1`in the *Name* field.
3. Enter the value for the first column in the *Value* field.
4. Repeat the first three steps of all the columns that you have in your Coda table.

**Note:** Here, we've used the default table in Coda, which has three columns namely Column 1, Column 2, and Column 3. Please make sure that the column names in the *Name* field matches the names of the table columns in Coda.

### 3. Coda node

1. First of all, you'll have to enter credentials for the Coda node. You can find out how to do that [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/coda/).
2. Select the name of your document from the *Doc* dropdown list.
3. Select the name of your table from the *Table* dropdown list.
4. Click on *Execute Node* to run the workflow.
