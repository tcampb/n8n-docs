## Example usage

This workflow allows you to get the 50 most recent incidents and view only the desired fields. This example usage workflow uses the following nodes:

- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [ServiceNow]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.
