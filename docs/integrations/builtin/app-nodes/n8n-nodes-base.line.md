## Basic Operations

* Notification
    * Sends notifications to users or groups

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to send daily weather updates via a notification using the Line node. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/773) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow uses the following nodes.
- [Cron](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.cron/)
- [OpenWeatherMap](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.openweathermap/)
- [Line]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.
