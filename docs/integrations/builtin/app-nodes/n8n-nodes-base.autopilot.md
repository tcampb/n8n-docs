## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to create a new list, add a new contact to that list, update the contact, and get all contacts in the list using the Autopilot node. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/990-manage-contacts-via-autopilot/) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow uses the following nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [Autopilot]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

### 1. Start node

The Start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.


### 2. Autopilot node (create: list)

This node will create a new list called `n8n-docs` in Autopilot.

1. First of all, you'll have to enter credentials for the Autopilot node. You can find out how to do that [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/autopilot/).
2. Select 'List' from the ***Resource*** dropdown list.
3. Enter `n8n-docs` in the ***Name*** field.
4. Click on ***Execute Node*** to run the node.

In the screenshot below, you will notice that the node creates a new list with the name `n8n-docs`.
