## FAQs

### How do I list all files/folders within a folder?

To list all the files and folders within a folder, follow the steps mentioned below.

1. Toggle ***Use Query String*** to `true`.
2. Copy the string of characters located after `https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/`. This string is the folder ID.
