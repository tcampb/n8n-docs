# Elasticsearch

[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) is a distributed, free and open search and analytics engine for all types of data, including textual, numerical, geospatial, structured, and unstructured.

!!! note "Credentials"
    You can find authentication information for this node [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/elasticsearch/).


## Basic operations

* Document
    * Create a document
    * Delete a document
    * Get a document
    * Get all documents
    * Update a document
* Index
    * Create
    * Delete
    * Get
    * Get All

## Example usage

This workflow allows you to get all documents for a selected index. This example usage workflow uses the following nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [Elasticsearch]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

### 1. Start node

The Start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.

### 2. Elasticsearch node
