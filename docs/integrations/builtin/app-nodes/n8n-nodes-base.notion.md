- [Calendly Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.calendlytrigger/)
- [Notion]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

### 1. Calendly Trigger node

The Calendly node will trigger the workflow when an invite gets created.

1. First of all, you'll have to enter credentials for the Notion node. You can find out how to do that [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/calendly/).
2. Select 'invitee.created' from the ***Events*** dropdown list.
3. Save your workflow so that the webhook gets registered.
4. Click on ***Execute Node*** to run the node.

**Note:** Since you'll be using the test webhook while building the workflow, the node only stays active for 120 seconds. After you click on the ***Execute Node*** button, create an invite via Calendly.

In the screenshot below, you will notice that the Calendly Trigger node triggers the workflow when an invite is created.
