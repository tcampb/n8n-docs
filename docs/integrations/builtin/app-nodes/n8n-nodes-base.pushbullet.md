!!! note "Credentials"
    You can find authentication information for this node [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/pushbullet/).


## Basic Operations

* Push
    * Create a push
    * Delete a push
    * Get all pushes
    * Update a push

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to send daily weather updates via a push notification using the Pushbullet node. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/740) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow uses the following nodes.
- [Cron](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.cron/)
- [OpenWeatherMap](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.openweathermap/)
- [Pushbullet]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.
