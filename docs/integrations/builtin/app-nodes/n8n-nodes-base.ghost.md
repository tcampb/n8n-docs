## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to create, update, and get a post in Ghost. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/825) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow would use the following nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [Ghost]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

### 1. Start node

The start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.

### 2. Ghost node (create: post)

This node will create a new post with the title `Running ghost with n8n!`. If you want to create a post with a different title, use that instead.

4. Enter `Running ghost with n8n!` in the ***Title*** field.
5. Enter the HTML content in the ***Content*** field.
