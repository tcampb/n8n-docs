### 1. Start node

The start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.

## FAQs

### How do I find the List ID?

1. Open the Trello board that contains the list.
2. If the list doesn't have any cards, add a card to the list.
3. Open the card, add '.json' at the end of the URL, and press enter.
4. In the JSON file, you will see a field called `idList`.
5. Copy `idList`and paste it in the *List ID* field in n8n.
