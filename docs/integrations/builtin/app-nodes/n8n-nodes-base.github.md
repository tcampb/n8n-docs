## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to get the community profile of a GitHub repository. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/450) on the website. This example usage workflow uses the following two nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [GitHub]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.
