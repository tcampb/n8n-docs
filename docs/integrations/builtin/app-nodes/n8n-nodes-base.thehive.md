- Mark an alert as read
- Mark an alert as unread
- Merge an alert into an existing case
- Promote an alert into a case
- Update an alert


**Case**
- Count cases
- Create a case
- Execute a responder on a specified case
- Get all cases
- Get a single case
- Update a case


**Log**
- Create a task log
- Execute a responder on a selected log
- Get all task logs
- Get a single log


**Observable**
- Count observables
- Create an observable
- Execute an analyzer

- Get all observables of a specific case
- Get a single observable
- Search observables
- Update an observable


**Task**
- Count tasks
- Create a task

- Search tasks
- Update a task


## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to create, update, and get a case in TheHive. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/808) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow uses the following nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [TheHive]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

### 1. Start node

The start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.

### 2. TheHive node (create: case)

This node will create a new case in TheHive with the title `n8n` and set its severity to `low`. You can create a case with a different title and severity.

1. First of all, you'll have to enter credentials for the TheHive node. You can find out how to do that [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/theHive/).
2. Select 'Case' from the ***Resource*** dropdown list.
3. Select 'Create' from the ***Operation*** dropdown list.
4. Enter a title in the ***Title*** field.
5. Enter a description in the ***Description*** field.
6. Select 'Low' from the ***Severity*** dropdown list.
7. Set the start date in the ***Start Date*** field.
8. Enter a case owner in the ***Owner*** field.
9. Enter tags in the ***Tags*** field. You can enter multiple tags separate by a comma.
10. Click on ***Execute Node*** to run the node.

In the screenshot below, you will notice that the node creates a new case with the title `n8n` and `low` severity .

### 3. TheHive node (update: case)

This node will update the case that we created in the previous node. We will update the severity of the case.

1. Select the credentials that you entered in the previous node.
2. Select 'Case' from the ***Resource*** dropdown list.
3. Select 'Update' from the ***Operation*** dropdown list.
4. Click on the gears icon next to the ***Case ID*** field and click on ***Add Expression***.
5. Select the following in the ***Variable Selector*** section: Nodes > TheHive > Output Data > JSON > id. You can also add the following expression: `{{$node["TheHive"].json["id"]}}`.
6. Click on ***Add Field*** and select 'Severity' from the dropdown list.
7. Select 'High' from the ***Severity*** dropdown list.
8. Click on ***Execute Node*** to run the node.

In the screenshot below, you will notice that the node updates the severity of the case that we created in the previous node.

### 4. TheHive node (get: case)

This node will return the information of the case that we created in the previous node.

1. Select the credentials that you entered in the previous node.
2. Select 'Case' from the ***Resource*** dropdown list.
3. Select 'Get' from the ***Operation*** dropdown list.
4. Click on the gears icon next to the ***Case ID*** field and click on ***Add Expression***.
5. Select the following in the ***Variable Selector*** section: Nodes > TheHive > Output Data > JSON > id. You can also add the following expression: `{{$node["TheHive"].json["id"]}}`.
6. Click on ***Execute Node*** to run the node.

In the screenshot below, you will notice that the node returns the information of the case that we created earlier.
