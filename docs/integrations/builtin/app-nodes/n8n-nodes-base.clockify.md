This workflow allows you to create a project, tag, and time entry in Clockify. It also allows you to update the time entry in Clockify. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/701) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow would use the following nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [Clockify]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

### 1. Start node

The start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.


### 2. Clockify node (create: project)

This node will create a private project with a custom color. It will also add a note to the project in Clockify.
