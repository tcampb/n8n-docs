    You can find authentication information for this node [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/spontit/).


## Basic Operations

* Push
    * Create a push notification

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to send daily weather updates via a push notification using the Spontit node. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/796) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow uses the following nodes.

- [Schedule Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/)
- [OpenWeatherMap](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.openweathermap/)
- [Spontit]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.
