## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to send financial metrics monthly to a Mattermost channel. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/798) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow uses the following nodes.
- [Cron](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.cron/)
- [ProfitWell]()
- [Mattermost](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mattermost/)

The final workflow should look like the following image.

!!! note "Activate workflow for production"
