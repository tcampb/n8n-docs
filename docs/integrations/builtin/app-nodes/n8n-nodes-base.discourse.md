## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to create, update, and get a post using the Discourse node. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/930) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow would use the following nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [Discourse]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

### 1. Start node

The start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.

### 2. Discourse node (create: post)

This node will create a post under the `Lounge` category. If you want to create a post under a different category, select that category instead.

1. First of all, you'll have to enter credentials for the Discourse node. You can find out how to do that [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/discourse/).
2. Enter a title for the post in the ***Title*** field.
3. Enter the content of the post in the ***Content*** field.
4. Click on ***Add Field*** and select 'Category ID' from the dropdown list.
5. Select 'Lounge' from the ***Category ID*** dropdown list.
6. Click on ***Execute Node*** to run the node.

In the screenshot below, you will notice that the node creates a new topic under the category `Lounge`.
