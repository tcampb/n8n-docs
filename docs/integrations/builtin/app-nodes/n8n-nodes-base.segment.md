# Segment

[Segment](https://segment.com/) is a customer data platform (CDP) that helps you collect, clean, and control your customer data.

!!! note "Credentials"
    You can find authentication information for this node [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/segment/).


## Basic Operations

* Group
    * Add a user to a group
* Identify
    * Create an identity
* Track
    * Record the actions your users perform. Every action triggers an event, which can also have associated properties.
    * Record page views on your website, along with optional extra information about the page being viewed.

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to track an event in Segment. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/495) on the website. This example usage workflow would use the following two nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [Segment]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

### 1. Start node

The start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.
