[Webflow](https://webflow.com) is an application that allows you to build responsive websites with browser-based visual editing software.

!!! note "Credentials"
    You can find authentication information for this node [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/webflow/).


## Basic Operations

* Item
    * Create
    * Delete
    * Get
    * Get All
    * Update

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to create, update, and get an item from Webflow. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1048) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow would use the following nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [Webflow]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

### 1. Start node

The start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.

### 2. Webflow node (create: item)

This node will create a new collection of the type `Team Members` in Webflow. If you want to create a collection with a different type, use that type instead.

1. First of all, you'll have to enter credentials for the Webflow node. You can find out how to do that [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/webflow/).
2. Select 'Create' from the ***Operation*** dropdown list.
3. Select your site from the ***Site ID*** dropdown list.
4. Select 'Team Members' from the ***Collection ID*** dropdown list.
5. Click on the ***Add Field*** button.
6. Select 'Name (PlainText) (required)' from the ***Field ID*** dropdown list. If you're using a different collection type, select the field present in that collection.
7. Enter `n8n` in the ***Field Value*** field.
8. Click on the ***Add Field*** button.
9. Select 'Slug (PlainText) (required)' from the ***Field ID*** dropdown list. If you're using a different collection type, select the field present in that collection.
10. Enter `n8n` in the ***Field Value*** field.
11. Click on the ***Add Field*** button.
12. Select 'Archived (Bool) (required)' from the ***Field ID*** dropdown list. If you're using a different collection type, select the field present in that collection.
13. Enter `false` in the ***Field Value*** field.
14. Click on the ***Add Field*** button.
15. Select 'Draft (Bool) (required)' from the ***Field ID*** dropdown list. If you're using a different collection type, select the field present in that collection.
16. Enter `false` in the ***Field Value*** field.
17. Click on ***Execute Node*** to run the node.

In the screenshot below, you will notice that the node creates a new item for the collection type `Team Members` in Webflow.
