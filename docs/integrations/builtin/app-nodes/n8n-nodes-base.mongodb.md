# MongoDB

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is a cross-platform document-oriented database program developed by MongoDB Inc. It is classified as a NoSQL database program. MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas.

!!! note "Credentials"
    You can find authentication information for this node [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/mongoDb/).


## Operations

* Aggregate documents
* Delete documents
* Find documents
* Find and replace documents
* Find and update documents
* Insert documents
* Update documents


## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to insert a document into a MongoDB collection. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/503) on the website. This example usage workflow would use the following three nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [Set](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/)
- [MongoDB]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.
