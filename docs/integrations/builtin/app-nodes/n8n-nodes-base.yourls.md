# Yourls

[Yourls](http://yourls.org/) is a free and open-source software that allows you to run your URL shortening service.

!!! note "Credentials"
    You can find authentication information for this node [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/yourls/).


## Basic Operations

* URL
    * Expand a URL
    * Shorten a URL
    * Get stats about one short URL

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to create a short URL and get the statistics of the URL. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/815) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow uses the following nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [Yourls]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

### 1. Start node

The start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.

### 2. Yourls node (shorten: url)

This node will create  a short URL for the link we specify.

1. First of all, you'll have to enter credentials for the Yourls node. You can find out how to do that [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/yourls/).
2. Enter the URL that you want to shorten in the ***URL*** field.
3. Click on ***Add Field*** and select 'Title'.
4. Enter a title in the ***Title*** field.
5. Click on ***Execute Node*** to run the node.

In the screenshot below, you will notice that the node creates a short URL for the URL you specified.

### 3. Yourls1 node (stats: url)

This node will give us the statistics of the short URL that we specify. We will get the statistics for the URL that we created in the previous step.

1. Select the credentials that you entered in the previous node.
2. Select 'Stats' from the ***Operation*** dropdown list.
3. Click on the gears icon next to the ***Short URL*** field and click on ***Add Expression***.
4. Select the following in the ***Variable Selector*** section: Nodes > Yourls > Output Data > JSON > shorturl. You can also add the following expression: `{{$node["Yourls"].json["shorturl"]}}`.
5. Click on ***Execute Node*** to run the node.

In the screenshot below, you will notice that the node gives us the statistics of the short URL that we created in the previous node.
