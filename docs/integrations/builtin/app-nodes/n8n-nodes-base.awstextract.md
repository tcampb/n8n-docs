## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to extract data from a an invoice stored in AWS S3. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1282) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow uses the following nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [AWS S3](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.awsS3/)
- [AWS Textract]()

The final workflow looks like the following image.
