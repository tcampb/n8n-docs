### 1. Typeform Trigger node

This node will trigger the workflow when a form response is submitted.

This example workflow uses a Typeform to collect name and email address. Create a form exactly like [this](https://n8ndocsburner.typeform.com/to/dpr2kxSL) for the example workflow. Below are the questions and their question types for the form.

|Question | Type  |
|---------|-------|
|Let's start with your name. | Short Text |
|What's your email address? | Email |

1. First of all, you'll have to enter credentials for the Typeform Trigger node. You can find out how to do that [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/typeform/).
2. Select your form from the ***Form*** dropdown list.
3. Click on ***Execute Node*** to run the workflow.

In the screenshot below, you will notice that the Typeform Trigger node triggers the workflow and returns the response submitted by a user.
