## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to create a folder in Nextcloud, upload a file into that folder, and list the contents of the folder. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/620) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow would use the following nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [Nextcloud]()
- [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/)

The final workflow should look like the following image.
