## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to create, update, and get a work item from Kitemaker. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1048) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow would use the following nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [Kitemaker]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.
