# Deploy a node

This section contains details on how to deploy and share your node.

You can choose to:

* [Submit your node to the community node repository](/integrations/creating-nodes/deploy/submit-community-nodes/). This makes it available for everyone to use, and allows you to [install and use it](/integrations/community-nodes/installation/) like any other community node. This is the only way to use custom nodes on cloud.
* Install the node into your n8n instance as a [private node](/integrations/creating-nodes/deploy/install-private-nodes/).
