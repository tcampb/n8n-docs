# Connection

A connection establishes a link between nodes to route data through the workflow. A connection between two nodes passes data from one node's output to another node's input. Each node can have one or multiple connections.

To create a connection between two nodes, click on the grey dot on the right side of the node and slide the arrow to the grey rectangle on the left side of the following node.

## Example

An [IF node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) has two connections to different nodes: one for when the statement is true and one for when the statement is false.
