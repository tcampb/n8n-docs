# Sticky Notes

Sticky Notes allow you to annotate and comment on your workflows.

n8n recommends using Sticky Notes heavily, especially on template workflows, to help other users understand your workflow.

## Create a Sticky Note

Sticky Notes are a core node. To add a new Sticky Note:

1. Open the nodes panel.
2. Search for `note`.
3. Click the **Sticky Note** node. n8n adds a new Sticky Note to the canvas.

## Edit a Sticky Note

1. Double click the Sticky Note you want to edit.
2. Write your note. [This guide](https://commonmark.org/help/) explains how to format your text with Markdown. n8n uses [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it), which implements the CommonMark specification. 
3. Click away from the note, or press `Esc`, to stop editing.

## Sticky Note positioning

You can:

* Drag a Sticky Note anywhere on the canvas.
* Drag Sticky Notes behind nodes. You can use this to visually group nodes.
* Resize Sticky Notes by hovering over the edge of the note and dragging to resize.

## Writing in Markdown

Sticky Notes support Markdown formatting. This section describes some common options.

```
The text in double asterisks will be **bold**

The text in single asterisks will be *italic*

Use # to indicate headings:
# This is a top-level heading
## This is a sub-heading
### This is a smaller sub-heading

You can add links:
[Example](https://example.com/)

Create lists with asterisks:

* Item one
* Item two

Or created ordered lists with numbers:

1. Item one
2. Item two
```
