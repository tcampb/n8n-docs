# Executions

An execution is a single run of a workflow.

To browse all executions:

Select **Executions** <span class="inline-image">![Executions menu icon](/_images/common-icons/executions-menu.png)</span> in the left menu to view your executions history. n8n opens the **Workflow Executions** modal. You can then open and view individual executions.

To view executions for a single workflow:

In the workflow, select **Executions** in the top menu. You can preview all executions of that workflow.
