# Processing data with code

## Function

A function is a block of code designed to perform a certain task. In n8n, you can write custom JavaScript code snippets to add, remove, and update the data you receive from a node.

The [Code](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/)node gives you access to the incoming data and you can manipulate it. With this node you can implement any function you want using JavaScript code.
