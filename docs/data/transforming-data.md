# Transforming data

n8n uses a predefined [data structure](/data/data-structure/) that allows all nodes to process incoming data correctly.

Your incoming data may have a different data structure, in which case you will need to transform it to allow each item to be processed individually.

For example, the image below shows the output of an [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node that returns data incompatible with n8n's data structure. The node returns the data and displays that only one item was returned.

![HTTP Request node output](/_images/data/transforming-data/HTTPRequest_output.png)

To transform this kind of structure into the n8n data structure you can use the [Item Lists](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.itemlists/) node.

!!! note
    If you're using the HTTP Request node, you should use the Split Into items option to transform the data. You don't have to use a Function node in that case.
